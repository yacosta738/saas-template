# Project Overview

This is a production-ready monorepo template for building SaaS applications. It includes a Spring Boot + Kotlin backend, modern frontend apps (Vite / Astro / Vue), and standardized infrastructure with Docker Compose. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for engineering teams to build upon, with batteries-included for CI, linting, testing, and security.
