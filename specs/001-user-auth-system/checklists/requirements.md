# Specification Quality Checklist: Secure Authentication System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 20, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Ready for planning phase

The specification has been successfully validated and all quality criteria have been met:

### Clarifications Resolved

The original [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker regarding logout behavior has been resolved with the following decision:

- **Single-device logout is the default**: Logging out terminates only the current session
- **Session management panel**: Users can view all active sessions with device/location metadata
- **Global logout option**: Users can manually trigger logout from all devices via the session management panel

This clarification resulted in:

- New User Story 8: Session Management and Multi-Device Control (Priority P3)
- Additional functional requirements (FR-031 through FR-038) for session management capabilities
- Enhanced Session entity definition with device type, location, and status fields
- New success criteria (SC-016 through SC-018) for session management performance
- Updated assumptions (items 10-11) clarifying logout behavior and session management access

### Quality Assessment

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is entirely technology-agnostic, focusing on user value and business needs without implementation details.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 38 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Edge cases comprehensively cover security, concurrency, and error scenarios.

3. **Feature Readiness**: The specification provides a clear roadmap with 8 prioritized user stories (3 P1, 4 P2, 1 P3), enabling iterative development starting with the MVP (registration, login, logout).

### Next Steps

The specification is ready for the next phase. You can now proceed with:

- `/speckit.plan` - Generate a technical implementation plan
- Further refinement of specific user stories if needed
- Beginning implementation of P1 stories for MVP

## Notes

**Specification Highlights**:

- **8 User Stories**: Prioritized from P1 (MVP-critical) to P3 (enhancements)
- **38 Functional Requirements**: Covering authentication, authorization, session management, and security
- **18 Success Criteria**: Measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- **17 Assumptions**: Clear technical and business constraints
- **4 Key Entities**: User, Session, Authentication Event, Federated Identity Link
- **12 Edge Cases**: Security, concurrency, and error handling scenarios

**Security Focus**: The specification emphasizes security throughout, including CSRF/XSS protection, rate limiting, token management, audit logging, and secure session handling.

**Session Management Innovation**: The addition of the session management panel (User Story 8) provides users with transparency and control over their active sessions, enhancing both security and user experience beyond typical authentication systems.
