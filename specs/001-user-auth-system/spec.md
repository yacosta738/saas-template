# Feature Specification: Secure Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-auth-system`
**Created**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a secure authentication system that enables users to login, register, and manage their session state. Users can authenticate via email/password credentials or federated identity providers. The system must seamlessly handle token lifecycle management, redirect users to protected resources post-authentication, and provide graceful session recovery mechanisms. Registration captures essential user data with validation feedback, while logout cleanly terminates sessions and revokes tokens. The frontend consumes Keycloak endpoints for all auth operations and maintains real-time user context across the application."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration with Email/Password (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the application and creates an account using their email address and password. The system validates their input in real-time, provides clear feedback on validation errors, and successfully creates their account upon submission. After successful registration, the user is automatically authenticated and can access the application.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the authentication system. Without the ability to create accounts, no users can access the application. This represents the minimum viable authentication capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the registration page, filling out the form with valid data, submitting, and verifying that a new user account is created and the user can immediately access protected resources.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the registration page, **When** they enter valid email, password, and required profile information, **Then** their account is created successfully and they are redirected to the main application area with an active session.

2. **Given** a user is filling out the registration form, **When** they enter an invalid email format, **Then** they see an immediate validation error message indicating the email format is incorrect.

3. **Given** a user is filling out the registration form, **When** they enter a password that doesn't meet security requirements, **Then** they see real-time feedback showing which password criteria are not met.

4. **Given** a user tries to register, **When** they use an email address that already exists in the system, **Then** they receive a clear error message indicating the email is already registered and are offered options to login or reset password.

5. **Given** a user successfully registers, **When** the registration completes, **Then** they receive a confirmation and their session is established without requiring an additional login step.

---

### User Story 2 - User Login with Email/Password (Priority: P1)

A registered user visits the application and logs in using their email address and password. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected to their intended destination (either the page they originally requested or a default landing page). If authentication fails, they receive clear feedback about why and can retry.

**Why this priority**: Login is equally critical as registration for the MVP. Existing users must be able to access their accounts. This priority level ensures users can both create and access accounts in the first iteration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the login page, entering valid credentials, submitting, and verifying that the user is authenticated and redirected appropriately with an active session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user visits the login page, **When** they enter their correct email and password, **Then** they are successfully authenticated and redirected to their intended destination with an active session.

2. **Given** a user tries to access a protected page without being authenticated, **When** they are redirected to login and successfully authenticate, **Then** they are automatically returned to the originally requested protected page.

3. **Given** a user enters incorrect login credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they see a clear, security-conscious error message (not revealing which field is incorrect) and can retry.

4. **Given** a user is on the login page, **When** they click a "Forgot Password" option, **Then** they are directed to a password recovery flow.

5. **Given** an authenticated user with an active session, **When** they navigate to the login page, **Then** they are automatically redirected to the main application area.

---

### User Story 3 - Federated Identity Provider Login (Priority: P2)

A user chooses to authenticate using a federated identity provider (such as Google, Microsoft, or GitHub) instead of creating a local account. They click the provider's login button, are redirected to the provider's authentication page, authorize the application, and are returned with an established session. Their profile information is populated from the identity provider.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for user convenience and reducing registration friction, this is not essential for the MVP. Users can still fully utilize the system with email/password authentication. This enhancement improves user experience but is not blocking for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking a federated login button, completing authentication on the provider's site, and verifying that the user is returned with an active session and their profile populated from the provider.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new or returning user is on the login page, **When** they click a federated identity provider button (e.g., "Sign in with Google"), **Then** they are redirected to the provider's authentication page.

2. **Given** a user authorizes the application with their identity provider, **When** they are redirected back to the application, **Then** they have an active session and their profile is populated with information from the provider.

3. **Given** a user authenticates via a federated provider for the first time, **When** the authentication completes, **Then** a new account is automatically created for them using their provider profile information.

4. **Given** a user has previously linked a federated identity provider, **When** they authenticate via that provider, **Then** they are logged into their existing account.

5. **Given** a federated authentication fails or is cancelled, **When** the user is returned to the application, **Then** they see a clear message about the failure and remain on the login page with the ability to try again or use alternative authentication methods.

---

### User Story 4 - Session Token Management and Refresh (Priority: P2)

While a user is actively using the application, the system automatically manages their authentication tokens behind the scenes. When the access token nears expiration, the system silently refreshes it using the refresh token, maintaining the user's session without interruption. If token refresh fails, the user is gracefully prompted to re-authenticate.

**Why this priority**: This provides a seamless user experience but is not essential for the MVP. In the initial release, users could re-authenticate manually when their session expires. Automatic token refresh is an enhancement that improves usability but doesn't block core authentication functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by establishing a session, waiting for the token to approach expiration, and verifying that the token is automatically refreshed and the user's session continues uninterrupted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user is actively using the application, **When** their access token approaches expiration, **Then** the system automatically refreshes the token in the background without user awareness or interruption.

2. **Given** a user has an active session, **When** their refresh token is still valid but their access token has expired, **Then** the system uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token seamlessly.

3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** both their access and refresh tokens have expired, **Then** they are gracefully redirected to the login page with a message explaining their session has expired.

4. **Given** a token refresh operation fails due to network issues, **When** the error is temporary, **Then** the system retries the refresh operation a reasonable number of times before prompting the user to re-authenticate.

5. **Given** a user's refresh token has been revoked (e.g., due to a password change), **When** the system attempts to refresh their access token, **Then** they are immediately logged out and required to re-authenticate.

---

### User Story 5 - Session Recovery and Persistence (Priority: P3)

A user closes their browser or navigates away from the application while authenticated. When they return later (within the session validity period), their session is automatically restored without requiring re-authentication. The application recognizes them and maintains their authentication state across browser sessions.

**Why this priority**: Session persistence improves convenience but is not critical for the MVP. Users can simply log in again when they return. This feature enhances user experience by reducing authentication friction for returning users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by authenticating, closing the browser, reopening it, navigating to the application, and verifying that the session is automatically restored without requiring re-authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they close their browser and return within the session validity period, **Then** they are automatically logged back in without re-entering credentials.

2. **Given** a user with a persistent session, **When** they navigate directly to a protected resource, **Then** they can access it immediately without being redirected to login.

3. **Given** a user's persistent session has expired, **When** they return to the application, **Then** they are prompted to log in again with a clear message explaining the expiration.

4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they explicitly choose "Remember Me" during login, **Then** their session persists for an extended period (e.g., 30 days) instead of the standard session duration.

5. **Given** a user is accessing the application from a public or shared device, **When** they login without selecting "Remember Me", **Then** their session expires when they close the browser for security purposes.

---

### User Story 6 - User Logout (Priority: P1)

An authenticated user decides to end their session and clicks the logout button. The system immediately terminates their session, revokes their authentication tokens, clears all session data, and redirects them to a public page (such as login or homepage). After logout, they cannot access protected resources without re-authenticating.

**Why this priority**: Logout is a critical security feature that must be included in the MVP. Users must have a reliable way to terminate their sessions, especially when using shared devices or for security compliance. This is not optional for a production authentication system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by authenticating, clicking logout, and verifying that the session is terminated, tokens are invalidated, and protected resources are no longer accessible without re-authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click the logout button, **Then** their session is immediately terminated and they are redirected to the login page or public homepage.

2. **Given** a user has just logged out, **When** they attempt to access a protected resource, **Then** they are redirected to the login page and required to authenticate again.

3. **Given** a user logs out, **When** the logout process completes, **Then** all authentication tokens (access and refresh tokens) for the current session are revoked on the server side.

4. **Given** a user logs out, **When** the logout completes, **Then** all client-side session data and tokens are cleared from browser storage.

5. **Given** a user logs out from one browser or device, **When** they have active sessions on other devices, **Then** only the current session is terminated and other active sessions remain valid.

6. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they access the session management panel, **Then** they can view all their active sessions with device and location metadata.

7. **Given** a user viewing their active sessions in the session management panel, **When** they select one or more sessions to terminate, **Then** those specific sessions are immediately revoked.

8. **Given** a user in the session management panel, **When** they choose to log out from all devices, **Then** all active sessions across all devices are immediately terminated and tokens are revoked.

---

### User Story 8 - Session Management and Multi-Device Control (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user accesses a dedicated session management panel where they can view all their currently active sessions across different devices and browsers. Each session displays metadata including device type, browser, location, and last activity time. Users can selectively terminate individual sessions or choose to log out from all devices simultaneously for enhanced security control.

**Why this priority**: Session management is a valuable security feature but not essential for the MVP. The core authentication system can function without it. Users can still log out from individual devices using the standard logout. This feature enhances security awareness and control but is an advanced capability suitable for later iterations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by authenticating from multiple devices/browsers, accessing the session management panel, viewing the list of active sessions with metadata, and selectively terminating specific sessions or all sessions globally.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user with sessions on multiple devices, **When** they access the session management panel, **Then** they see a list of all active sessions with device type, browser, approximate location (based on IP address), and last activity timestamp.

2. **Given** a user viewing the session management panel, **When** they identify their current session, **Then** it is clearly marked as "Current session" to prevent accidental self-logout.

3. **Given** a user in the session management panel, **When** they select a specific session and choose to terminate it, **Then** that session is immediately revoked and removed from the list.

4. **Given** a user in the session management panel, **When** they click "Log out all devices" or "End all sessions", **Then** all sessions except the current one are terminated, and they receive confirmation of the action.

5. **Given** a user terminates a session remotely via the session management panel, **When** that device attempts to access a protected resource, **Then** they are immediately logged out and required to re-authenticate.

6. **Given** a user with sessions across multiple devices, **When** a session has been inactive for an extended period, **Then** it is marked with an indicator (e.g., "Inactive for 7 days") to help users identify stale sessions.

---

### User Story 7 - Real-Time User Context Across Application (Priority: P2)

Throughout the user's session, the application maintains and displays their current authentication state. The user's profile information, authentication status, and permissions are consistently available across all parts of the application. When the authentication state changes (login, logout, token refresh), the entire application reflects this change immediately.

**Why this priority**: While important for a polished user experience, this is not blocking for the MVP. The core authentication flows can work without real-time synchronization across all application components. This is an enhancement that improves consistency and user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by authenticating, observing that user context appears throughout the application, performing an action that changes auth state (e.g., logout in one component), and verifying that all other components immediately reflect the state change.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user logs in, **When** the authentication completes, **Then** their profile information and authentication status are immediately available throughout the application.

2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they navigate between different sections of the application, **Then** their user context and authentication state remain consistent and accessible.

3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** their session expires or they log out, **Then** all components of the application immediately reflect the unauthenticated state.

4. **Given** multiple components display user information, **When** the user's profile is updated, **Then** all components reflect the updated information without requiring a page refresh.

5. **Given** a user's permissions or roles change, **When** the change is processed, **Then** the application immediately enforces the new permissions across all features and views.

## Assumptions

1. **Authentication Provider**: The system integrates with Keycloak as the identity and access management provider, with Keycloak handling token issuance, validation, and revocation operations.

2. **Session Storage**: The application uses secure HTTP-only cookies for storing authentication tokens in standard sessions, with additional local storage or session storage for UI state management.

3. **Token Standards**: All tokens follow JWT (JSON Web Token) standards with appropriate signing algorithms (RS256 or similar asymmetric algorithms).

4. **HTTPS Requirement**: All authentication operations occur over HTTPS connections to ensure credential and token confidentiality.

5. **Password Strength**: Password security requirements follow OWASP guidelines including minimum 12 character length, requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

6. **Session Duration**: Standard sessions expire after 1 hour of inactivity, while "Remember Me" sessions persist for 30 days.

7. **Browser Support**: The system supports modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled and cookies allowed.

8. **Email Uniqueness**: Email addresses serve as unique identifiers for user accounts, with one account per email address.

9. **Federated Providers**: Initially supporting Google, Microsoft, and GitHub as federated identity providers, with the architecture allowing additional providers to be added.

10. **Logout Behavior**: By default, logout from one device/browser terminates only that specific session, leaving other active sessions on other devices unaffected. Users can manually terminate all sessions globally via the session management panel.

11. **Session Management Access**: All authenticated users have access to a session management panel where they can view and manage their active sessions across devices.

12. **Token Refresh Window**: Access tokens are refreshed automatically when they have 5 minutes or less remaining before expiration.

13. **Rate-Limiting**: Failed authentication attempts are rate-limited to maximum 5 attempts per email address within a 15-minute sliding window, with exponential backoff for subsequent attempts.

14. **Profile Information**: Minimum required registration information includes email address, password (for local accounts), first name, and last name. Additional optional profile fields can be collected but are not required for account creation.

15. **Audit Retention**: Authentication event logs are retained for minimum 90 days for security auditing and compliance purposes.

16. **Error Recovery**: Network failures during authentication operations result in user-friendly error messages with retry options, not technical stack traces or sensitive system information.

17. **Geolocation Accuracy**: Session location information is derived from IP address geolocation and provides approximate location (city/region level), not precise coordinates, for privacy reasons.
