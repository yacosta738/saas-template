# Feature Specification: Workspace Selection Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `002-workspace-selection`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Workspace Selection Implementation - We need to implement the functionality to select a workspace in the application. The backend endpoints are already implemented. There is a basic component for selecting workspaces, but it lacks the logic to load available workspaces and select a workspace by updating the application. When the user logs in, the application must load the last selected workspace or the user's default workspace."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Workspace Load on Login (Priority: P1)

When a user successfully logs into the application, the system automatically loads their last selected workspace (if one exists) or their default workspace, allowing them to immediately access their work context without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical functionality as it ensures users have immediate access to their work environment upon login. Without this, users would always need to manually select a workspace after every login, creating friction and poor user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a user who has a previously selected workspace and verifying the workspace context is automatically loaded. Delivers immediate value by eliminating an extra step in the login flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with a previously selected workspace, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** the application automatically loads their last selected workspace
2. **Given** a user who has never selected a workspace before, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** the application automatically loads their default workspace
3. **Given** a user whose last selected workspace no longer exists, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** the application loads their default workspace and displays a notification that the previous workspace is unavailable

### User Story 2 - Manual Workspace Selection (Priority: P2)

Users can view a list of all workspaces they have access to and switch between them at any time during their session, with the application updating to reflect the new workspace context.

**Why this priority**: While automatic loading is critical, users need the ability to switch between workspaces during their session. This enables users who work across multiple projects or teams to easily change context.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the workspace selector, viewing available workspaces, selecting a different workspace, and verifying the application updates to show the new workspace context. Delivers value by enabling multi-workspace workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user with access to multiple workspaces, **When** the user opens the workspace selector, **Then** all available workspaces are displayed with their names and relevant metadata
2. **Given** a user viewing the workspace selector, **When** the user clicks on a different workspace, **Then** the application switches to that workspace and updates all workspace-dependent content
3. **Given** a user who has just switched workspaces, **When** the application reloads or the user logs in again, **Then** the newly selected workspace is remembered and automatically loaded
4. **Given** a user with only one workspace available, **When** the user opens the workspace selector, **Then** the single workspace is displayed with an indication that it's the only available option

---

### User Story 3 - Workspace Loading Feedback (Priority: P3)

When workspaces are being loaded or switched, users see clear visual feedback indicating the operation is in progress, preventing confusion about application state.

**Why this priority**: While not blocking core functionality, loading feedback significantly improves perceived performance and prevents users from thinking the application is unresponsive.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering workspace load/switch operations and observing loading indicators. Delivers value by improving user confidence and reducing perceived wait time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** workspaces are being loaded on login, **When** the loading is in progress, **Then** a loading indicator is displayed to the user
2. **Given** a user has clicked to switch workspaces, **When** the switch operation is in progress, **Then** a loading state is shown and user interactions are temporarily disabled to prevent conflicts
3. **Given** workspace loading or switching fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** a clear error message is displayed with guidance on how to proceed

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user's default workspace is deleted or they lose access to it?
- What happens when the workspace API endpoint returns an error during login?
- What happens when a user switches workspaces while there are unsaved changes in the current workspace?
- What happens when there are no workspaces available for the user?
- What happens when workspace data loads slowly due to network conditions?
- What happens when the user's session expires while switching workspaces?
- What happens if the backend returns an empty workspace list?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load all available workspaces for the authenticated user from the backend API endpoints
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically load the user's last selected workspace when they log in successfully
- **FR-003**: System MUST load the user's default workspace when they log in for the first time or when their last selected workspace is unavailable
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view a list of all workspaces they have access to through the workspace selector component
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to manually select any workspace from the list of available workspaces
- **FR-006**: System MUST update the application context (all workspace-dependent UI and data) when a workspace is selected
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist the user's workspace selection so it's remembered across sessions (stored in local storage or user preferences)
- **FR-008**: System MUST display loading indicators during workspace loading and switching operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when workspace loading fails, displaying user-friendly error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent users from initiating actions that require a workspace context before a workspace is loaded
- **FR-011**: System MUST display appropriate feedback when a user has no available workspaces
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle the case where the user's last selected workspace no longer exists by falling back to the default workspace

### Key Entities

- **Workspace**: Represents a work environment or project context. Contains workspace identifier, name, description, user access permissions, and default status indicator.
- **User Session**: Represents the authenticated user's current state. Contains current workspace selection, last selected workspace identifier, and authentication status.
- **Workspace Selection Preference**: Represents the user's workspace selection history. Contains user identifier, last selected workspace identifier, and timestamp of last selection.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users with a previously selected workspace see their workspace loaded within 2 seconds of successful login
- **SC-002**: Users can switch between workspaces in under 3 seconds from clicking the selector to seeing updated content
- **SC-003**: 100% of users who log in successfully have a workspace automatically loaded (either last selected or default)
- **SC-004**: Workspace selection persists across 100% of login sessions (no users need to reselect on every login)
- **SC-005**: Loading states are visible to users for any workspace operation taking longer than 500 milliseconds
- **SC-006**: Zero application crashes or unrecoverable errors when switching workspaces
- **SC-007**: Users with access to multiple workspaces can view and switch between all of them without errors

## Assumptions

The following assumptions were made to complete this specification:

1. **Backend API Stability**: The existing backend workspace endpoints are stable, documented, and ready for integration
2. **Authentication State**: User authentication state is reliably available to the frontend when workspace loading needs to occur
3. **Workspace Access Control**: The backend properly enforces access control and only returns workspaces the user has permission to access
4. **Default Workspace Rule**: Every user has exactly one default workspace assigned by the system
5. **Persistence Strategy**: Local storage is acceptable for storing the last selected workspace preference (with backend sync as an enhancement)
6. **Workspace Data Size**: The number of workspaces per user is reasonable (< 100) and can be loaded in a single request
7. **Session Management**: The application has proper session management that can detect when workspace context needs to be refreshed
8. **Concurrent Access**: Users typically work in one workspace at a time (no simultaneous multi-workspace sessions in different tabs requiring synchronization)
9. **Network Reliability**: Standard retry logic and error handling is sufficient for workspace API calls (no special offline mode required)
10. **UI Component State**: The existing workspace selector component can be enhanced with the required logic without major structural changes

## Dependencies

- **Backend Workspace API**: Requires functional endpoints for listing user workspaces, retrieving workspace details, and identifying default workspaces
- **Authentication System**: Depends on reliable authentication state and user session management
- **Frontend State Management**: Requires application state management solution (e.g., Pinia) to maintain workspace context across components
- **Routing System**: May need to integrate with application routing to handle workspace-specific URLs or navigation
