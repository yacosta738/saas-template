# Specification Quality Checklist: Workspace Selection Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

The specification successfully avoids implementation details and focuses on user value:

- No mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or technical implementations
- All requirements describe "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Written in language accessible to product managers and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

All requirements are well-defined and actionable:

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all decisions made with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions)
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds, 3 seconds, 100%, 500ms)
- Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes rather than technical metrics
- Three prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- Seven edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary cases
- Scope clearly bounded to workspace selection and loading (excludes workspace creation, deletion, management)
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

The specification is ready for planning phase:

- All 12 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover the complete workflow: auto-load on login (P1), manual selection (P2), loading feedback (P3)
- Seven measurable success criteria defined with specific targets
- No technical implementation details present (no mention of Pinia, Vue, API calls, etc.)

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

**Recommendations for planning phase**:

1. Identify which backend API endpoints exist and their contracts
2. Document the current state of the workspace selector component
3. Define the workspace state management approach (integration with existing store patterns)
4. Consider internationalization requirements for error messages and loading states
