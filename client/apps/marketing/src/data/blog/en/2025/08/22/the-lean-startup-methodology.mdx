The Lean Startup methodology provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and getting a desired product to customers' hands faster. In this article, we'll explore how to apply this methodology to your SaaS business.

### Build-Measure-Learn

The core of the Lean Startup methodology is the build-measure-learn feedback loop. The idea is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

An MVP is a version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

### Validated Learning

Validated learning is a process in which one learns by trying out an initial idea and then measuring it to validate the effect. Each test of an idea is a single iteration in a larger process of achieving a grand vision.
