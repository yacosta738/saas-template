Reactive programming enables efficient handling of concurrent requests with minimal threads. Combining Spring Boot's convenience with Kotlin's expressiveness and WebFlux's reactive capabilities creates a powerful stack for building responsive, resilient, and elastic applications.

In this guide, we'll build a simple reactive REST API that demonstrates non-blocking operations from controller to database.

## Project Setup

Start by generating your project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), selecting:
### 4. Configure Application Properties

Reactive programming enables efficient handling of concurrent requests with minimal threads. Combining Spring Boot's convenience with Kotlin's expressiveness and WebFlux's reactive capabilities creates a powerful stack for building responsive, resilient, and elastic applications.

In this guide we'll build a simple reactive REST API that demonstrates non-blocking operations from controller to database.

## Project setup

Generate your project using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io) with:

- Project: Gradle - Kotlin
- Language: Kotlin
- Spring Boot: 3.4.0
- Dependencies: Spring Reactive Web, Spring Data R2DBC, H2 Database

## The reactive flow

### 1. Define a data class

Create a simple data model:

```kotlin
data class Product(
    val id: Long? = null,
    val name: String,
    val price: Double
)
```

### 2. Create a reactive repository

Spring Data R2DBC provides reactive repository support:

```kotlin
interface ProductRepository : ReactiveCrudRepository<Product, Long>
```

### 3. Implement a reactive controller

WebFlux supports functional and annotation-based controllers; below is an annotation-based example:

```kotlin
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
class ProductController(private val productRepository: ProductRepository) {
    @GetMapping
    fun getAllProducts(): Flux<Product> = productRepository.findAll()

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    fun getProduct(@PathVariable id: Long): Mono<Product> = productRepository.findById(id)

    @PostMapping
    fun createProduct(@RequestBody product: Mono<Product>): Mono<Product> =
        product.flatMap { productRepository.save(it) }
}
```

### 4. Configure application properties

In `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:h2:file://./testdb
spring.r2dbc.username=sa
spring.r2dbc.password=
```

## Key benefits

- **Non-blocking I/O** — handle more concurrent requests with fewer threads
- **Backpressure-ready** — consumers control the data flow rate
- **Functional programming** — clean, expressive code with Kotlin
- **Scalability** — efficient resource utilization under heavy loads

## Best practices

- Embrace the reactive paradigm throughout your stack
- Use reactive database drivers (R2DBC, reactive MongoDB drivers)
- Test reactive code with `StepVerifier` from Project Reactor
- Monitor performance with Micrometer and observability tools

This combination provides a solid foundation for building responsive applications that handle high throughput with limited resources.
- Monitor performance with Micrometer and observability tools
