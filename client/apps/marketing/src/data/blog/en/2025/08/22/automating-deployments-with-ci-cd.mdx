Automating deployments reduces human error and speeds up delivery. In this guide we outline a minimal CI/CD pipeline for SaaS projects: run linting and tests, build artifacts, and deploy using immutable releases.

Start with small steps: automate unit tests and builds, then add integration tests and canary deployments. Use feature flags to decouple deploys from releases.

Best practices:
- Keep pipelines fast and observable
- Make rollbacks simple with versioned artifacts
- Test deploys in staging before production
