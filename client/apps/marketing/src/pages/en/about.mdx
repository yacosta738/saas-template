## What is this template?

This repository provides a lightweight, opinionated starter for building a SaaS product. It includes common patterns for a marketing site, documentation, asset structure, and developer tooling so teams can focus on product features instead of boilerplate.

Designed as a template, the project is intentionally generic so you can adapt it to your product and brand.

## Who is it for?

- Product teams launching a new SaaS offering.
- Developers who want a tested starting point with frontend, docs and example assets.
- Teams that value a clear project layout and sensible defaults.

## What you'll find here

- A marketing site with multilingual pages and legal templates.
- Documentation scaffolding powered by Astro / Starlight.
- Example assets (favicons, logos) and conventions for theming.
- CI-friendly linting, formatting, and build configuration.

## Customize it

Replace brand names, logos, and copy with your product's information. Remove or extend example pages as needed â€” this template is a foundation, not a strict opinion.
