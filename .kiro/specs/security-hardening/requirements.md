# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive security hardening for the Loomify SaaS platform to address critical security gaps and ensure enterprise-grade protection. The security hardening will add multiple layers of protection including rate limiting, DDoS protection, input sanitization, encryption, and compliance features to meet modern security standards and regulatory requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive rate limiting controls, so that I can prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage across all tenants and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exceeds the configured rate limit for an endpoint THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 status with retry-after header
2. WHEN a tenant exceeds their allocated request quota THEN the system SHALL throttle requests and log the violation
3. WHEN rate limiting is configured THEN the system SHALL support per-endpoint, per-tenant, and per-user rate limiting rules
4. WHEN rate limits are applied THEN the system SHALL provide configurable time windows (per second, minute, hour, day)
5. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for monitoring and alerting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want DDoS protection mechanisms, so that the platform remains available during malicious traffic attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suspicious traffic patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically throttle requests from offending sources
2. WHEN an IP address exceeds the attack threshold THEN the system SHALL temporarily block the IP address
3. WHEN DDoS protection is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a configurable blocklist with automatic expiration
4. WHEN traffic analysis occurs THEN the system SHALL distinguish between legitimate high traffic and attack patterns
5. WHEN protection measures are triggered THEN the system SHALL log security events for audit purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want dynamic CORS configuration management, so that I can control cross-origin requests securely across different environments and tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cross-origin request is made THEN the system SHALL validate against tenant-specific allowed origins
2. WHEN CORS configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring application restart
3. WHEN multiple tenants exist THEN the system SHALL support different CORS policies per tenant workspace
4. WHEN CORS validation fails THEN the system SHALL block the request and log the violation
5. WHEN CORS headers are set THEN the system SHALL include appropriate security headers (credentials, methods, headers)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want Content Security Policy headers implemented, so that we can prevent XSS attacks and meet security compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any web page is served THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CSP headers
2. WHEN CSP policies are configured THEN the system SHALL support different policies for different application sections
3. WHEN CSP violations occur THEN the system SHALL log violations for security monitoring
4. WHEN CSP is enabled THEN the system SHALL support nonce-based script execution for dynamic content
5. WHEN CSP headers are generated THEN the system SHALL include directives for scripts, styles, images, and frames

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive input sanitization, so that all user inputs are protected against XSS and injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL sanitize all input data before processing
2. WHEN HTML content is processed THEN the system SHALL remove or escape potentially dangerous elements
3. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN sanitization occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve legitimate content while removing threats
5. WHEN input is stored THEN the system SHALL apply output encoding when displaying user-generated content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want SQL injection prevention enforced, so that all database queries are protected against injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use only parameterized queries or prepared statements
2. WHEN dynamic SQL is required THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input parameters
3. WHEN query construction occurs THEN the system SHALL prevent direct string concatenation for user inputs
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose internal database structure in error messages
5. WHEN SQL operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log suspicious query patterns for monitoring

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want integrated secret management, so that sensitive configuration data is securely stored and accessed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL retrieve secrets from external secret management services
2. WHEN secrets are accessed THEN the system SHALL support both AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault
3. WHEN secrets are cached THEN the system SHALL implement secure in-memory caching with automatic rotation
4. WHEN secret retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms and proper error handling
5. WHEN secrets are used THEN the system SHALL never log or expose secret values in application logs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want encryption at rest for sensitive fields, so that personal and sensitive data is protected even if the database is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt the data using industry-standard encryption algorithms
2. WHEN encrypted data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL transparently decrypt the data for authorized access
3. WHEN encryption keys are managed THEN the system SHALL support key rotation without data loss
4. WHEN sensitive fields are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically apply encryption based on field annotations
5. WHEN encryption is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain performance within acceptable limits

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a privacy compliance manager, I want PII masking capabilities, so that we can comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PII data is displayed THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive information based on user permissions
2. WHEN data export occurs THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate masking rules for different export contexts
3. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN the system SHALL mask PII in log entries while maintaining audit integrity
4. WHEN PII masking is configured THEN the system SHALL support different masking strategies (partial, full, tokenization)
5. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure all PII is properly masked or anonymized
