# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The File Storage Abstraction feature provides a unified, multi-provider storage system for the Loomify SaaS platform. This system enables secure file uploads, downloads, and management across different storage backends (S3, Azure Blob, GCS, MinIO, local) with tenant-scoped access control, automatic processing capabilities, and quota management. The abstraction layer ensures consistent behavior regardless of the underlying storage provider while maintaining enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to upload files securely to my workspace, so that I can store and manage documents within my organization's isolated storage space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL validate the file against tenant-specific size limits and allowed file types
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically scope it to the user's tenant to ensure data isolation
3. WHEN a file upload is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate a pre-signed URL for direct upload to reduce server load
4. IF virus scanning is enabled THEN the system SHALL scan uploaded files before making them available
5. WHEN a file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL return a unique file identifier and metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple storage providers, so that I can choose the most appropriate backend for different environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring storage providers THEN the system SHALL support S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, and local filesystem
2. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow routing files to different providers based on tenant configuration or file type
3. WHEN a storage provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle failures and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN switching storage providers THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing file references
5. IF a provider requires specific configuration THEN the system SHALL validate connection parameters during startup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to access my uploaded files through secure, time-limited URLs, so that I can share files safely without exposing permanent access paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting file access THEN the system SHALL generate signed URLs with configurable expiration times
2. WHEN accessing a file THEN the system SHALL verify the user has permission to access files in the target tenant
3. WHEN a signed URL expires THEN the system SHALL deny access and require a new URL generation
4. IF a file is marked as private THEN the system SHALL only allow access to authorized users within the same tenant
5. WHEN generating public URLs THEN the system SHALL support CDN integration for improved performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to manage storage quotas for my workspace, so that I can control costs and ensure fair resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant is created THEN the system SHALL assign a default storage quota based on subscription plan
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL track storage usage against the tenant's quota
3. WHEN quota limits are approached THEN the system SHALL notify tenant administrators at 80% and 95% usage
4. IF quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent new uploads until space is freed or quota is increased
5. WHEN quota is updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new limits and update usage calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload large files efficiently, so that users can handle substantial documents and media files without timeout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files larger than 100MB THEN the system SHALL use multipart upload for improved reliability
2. WHEN a multipart upload fails THEN the system SHALL support resumable uploads from the last successful chunk
3. WHEN processing large uploads THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback to the client
4. IF network interruption occurs THEN the system SHALL allow upload resumption without starting over
5. WHEN multipart upload completes THEN the system SHALL automatically assemble chunks and verify file integrity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want automatic file processing capabilities, so that images are optimized and documents are prepared for efficient delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically generate thumbnails in multiple sizes
2. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL optionally compress files to reduce storage costs
3. WHEN processing is configured THEN the system SHALL support different processing rules per tenant or file type
4. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL store the original file and log the processing error
5. WHEN processed files are ready THEN the system SHALL update file metadata with available variants

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive access logging and audit trails, so that I can monitor file access patterns and ensure compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded, accessed, or deleted THEN the system SHALL log all operations with user, tenant, and timestamp information
2. WHEN suspicious access patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL generate security alerts
3. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL provide detailed access logs filterable by tenant, user, or time period
4. IF compliance requirements exist THEN the system SHALL support data retention policies for audit logs
5. WHEN files are shared externally THEN the system SHALL track and log all external access attempts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want monitoring and health checks for storage operations, so that I can ensure system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage operations occur THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on upload/download speeds, success rates, and error frequencies
2. WHEN storage providers are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup providers if configured
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert operators and provide diagnostic information
4. IF storage costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate cost alerts and usage reports
5. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL support graceful degradation and maintenance mode
