# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The notification system is a comprehensive multi-channel communication platform that enables Loomify to deliver notifications to users through various channels including email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messages. The system provides template management with internationalization support, provider abstraction for different delivery services, delivery tracking capabilities, user preference management, and intelligent rate limiting with batching and throttling mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple notification providers (SendGrid, AWS SES, Twilio, etc.), so that I can ensure reliable message delivery with fallback options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring notification providers THEN the system SHALL support multiple email providers (SendGrid, AWS SES, SMTP)
2. WHEN configuring notification providers THEN the system SHALL support multiple SMS providers (Twilio, AWS SNS)
3. WHEN configuring notification providers THEN the system SHALL support push notification providers (Firebase, APNs)
4. WHEN a primary provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to configured backup providers
5. IF provider configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and reject the configuration with clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send notifications through a unified API, so that I can deliver messages without worrying about provider-specific implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a notification THEN the system SHALL accept a unified notification request with recipient, template, and channel preferences
2. WHEN processing notifications THEN the system SHALL automatically select the appropriate provider based on configuration and availability
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL support synchronous and asynchronous delivery modes
4. WHEN delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to configured limits
5. IF notification content exceeds channel limits THEN the system SHALL truncate or split content appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to create and manage notification templates with internationalization support, so that I can deliver localized messages to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL support multiple languages with fallback to default language
2. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL support variable substitution with type validation
3. WHEN managing templates THEN the system SHALL provide versioning with rollback capabilities
4. WHEN rendering templates THEN the system SHALL validate all required variables are provided
5. IF template rendering fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and use fallback templates when available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my notification preferences, so that I can control which notifications I receive and through which channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing preferences THEN users SHALL be able to opt-in/opt-out of specific notification types
2. WHEN managing preferences THEN users SHALL be able to choose preferred delivery channels per notification type
3. WHEN managing preferences THEN users SHALL be able to set quiet hours for non-urgent notifications
4. WHEN updating preferences THEN the system SHALL respect user choices immediately for new notifications
5. IF legal requirements exist THEN the system SHALL enforce mandatory notifications that cannot be disabled
6. WHEN managing preferences THEN the system SHALL explicitly comply with applicable regulations (e.g., CAN-SPAM, GDPR, PECR) and specify which notification categories they affect.
7. WHEN managing preferences THEN the system SHALL provide unsubscribe semantics, including per notification type and delivery channel, effective change timelines, confirmation flows, and handling of bounced/invalid addresses.
8. WHEN managing preferences THEN the system SHALL define precedence rules for workspace-mandated notifications versus user opt-outs, ensuring mandatory notifications are logged and limited to legally required cases.
9. WHEN managing preferences THEN the system SHALL store per-channel consent with timestamps, source, versioned policy ID, and an audit trail for consent changes and mandatory flags.
10. WHEN managing preferences THEN the system SHALL enforce preference changes immediately for new notifications and define retention/expiry rules for consent records.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to track notification delivery metrics, so that I can monitor system performance and user engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status (sent, delivered, failed, bounced)
2. WHEN tracking email notifications THEN the system SHALL monitor opens, clicks, and unsubscribes
3. WHEN tracking SMS notifications THEN the system SHALL monitor delivery confirmations and replies
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide delivery metrics aggregated by time, channel, and template
5. IF tracking data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates via webhooks or polling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement rate limiting and batching, so that I can prevent spam, manage costs, and ensure reliable delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits per user, per channel, and globally
2. WHEN processing high volumes THEN the system SHALL batch notifications to optimize provider API usage
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for delayed delivery
4. WHEN batching notifications THEN the system SHALL respect provider-specific batch size limits
5. IF urgent notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL bypass rate limits for critical messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send in-app notifications, so that I can provide real-time updates to users within the application interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending in-app notifications THEN the system SHALL deliver messages to active user sessions in real-time
2. WHEN users are offline THEN the system SHALL store in-app notifications for delivery when they return
3. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL support different priority levels and visual styles
4. WHEN managing in-app notifications THEN users SHALL be able to mark notifications as read/unread
5. IF notification storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL archive old notifications based on configured retention policies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a workspace administrator, I want to manage notification settings at the workspace level, so that I can control communication policies for my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring workspace settings THEN administrators SHALL be able to set default notification preferences for new users
2. WHEN managing workspace policies THEN administrators SHALL be able to enforce mandatory notifications for compliance
3. WHEN configuring branding THEN administrators SHALL be able to customize notification templates with workspace branding
4. WHEN setting limits THEN administrators SHALL be able to configure rate limits and quotas per workspace
5. IF workspace policies conflict with user preferences THEN workspace policies SHALL take precedence for mandatory notifications
