# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive billing and subscription management engine that supports multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Paddle), subscription lifecycle management, usage-based billing, invoice generation, webhook handling, dunning management, and revenue recognition. The system will integrate with the existing workspace-based multi-tenancy architecture and provide enterprise-grade billing capabilities for SaaS applications.

5. IF invoice disputes occur THEN the system SHALL support credit notes and adjustments

### Requirement 6: Webhook Handling and Event Processing

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want reliable webhook processing with idempotency and retry logic so that payment events are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhooks are received THEN the system SHALL validate signatures and authenticate sources
2. WHEN webhook processing occurs THEN the system SHALL implement idempotency to prevent duplicate processing
3. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry mechanisms
