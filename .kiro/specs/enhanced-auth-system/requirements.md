# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the existing authentication and authorization system with comprehensive multi-tenancy support, advanced OAuth2/OIDC integration, sophisticated token management, role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), session management, and API key management. The system builds upon the existing Keycloak integration and workspace-based multi-tenancy to provide enterprise-grade security features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenancy Architecture Enhancement

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want robust tenant isolation mechanisms so that each workspace operates as a completely isolated tenant with its own security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses resources THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant isolation using workspace-based discriminators
2. WHEN tenant data is queried THEN the system SHALL automatically filter results by the current workspace context
3. WHEN cross-tenant access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the security violation
4. WHEN a new workspace is created THEN the system SHALL establish isolated security contexts and default permissions
5. IF a user belongs to multiple workspaces THEN the system SHALL maintain separate security contexts for each workspace

### Requirement 2: Enhanced OAuth2/OIDC Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using multiple identity providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, enterprise SSO) so that I can use my preferred authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates login THEN the system SHALL present available OAuth2/OIDC providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, enterprise SSO)
2. WHEN OAuth2 authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or update user accounts with provider-specific attributes
3. WHEN OIDC tokens are received THEN the system SHALL validate issuer, audience, and signature according to OIDC specifications
4. WHEN provider-specific scopes are requested THEN the system SHALL map them to internal permissions appropriately
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive information
6. WHEN using the authorization code flow THEN the system SHALL enforce PKCE by generating, storing, and verifying the code_challenge and code_verifier, and SHALL reject flows without valid PKCE.
7. WHEN handling OAuth2 callbacks THEN the system SHALL validate cryptographically random state and nonce values, binding them to the client session, and SHALL verify state to prevent CSRF and nonce in ID tokens to prevent replay attacks. Failure modes SHALL include clear error messages without leaking secrets.

### Requirement 3: Advanced JWT and Refresh Token Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want sophisticated token management with rotation policies and blacklisting so that I can maintain high security standards and revoke compromised tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access tokens are issued THEN the system SHALL include workspace context, roles, and expiration times
2. WHEN refresh tokens are used THEN the system SHALL implement automatic rotation with configurable policies
3. WHEN tokens need revocation THEN the system SHALL maintain a blacklist with efficient lookup mechanisms
4. WHEN token rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL invalidate old tokens and issue new ones atomically
5. IF suspicious token activity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke related tokens and notify administrators

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive RBAC/ABAC System

**User Story:** As a workspace administrator, I want fine-grained role-based and attribute-based access control so that I can define precise permissions for different user types and contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN roles are defined THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical role inheritance within workspaces
2. WHEN permissions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL consider both role-based and attribute-based rules
3. WHEN resource access is requested THEN the system SHALL evaluate user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental context
4. WHEN permission policies are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring user re-authentication
5. IF conflicting permissions exist THEN the system SHALL follow a deny-by-default policy with explicit allow rules

### Requirement 5: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want multiple authentication factors (TOTP, SMS, authenticator apps) so that my account remains secure even if my password is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL support TOTP, SMS, and authenticator app methods
2. WHEN users set up MFA THEN the system SHALL provide QR codes for authenticator apps and backup codes
3. WHEN MFA verification is required THEN the system SHALL prompt for the appropriate second factor
4. WHEN backup codes are used THEN the system SHALL invalidate them and prompt for new backup code generation
5. IF MFA setup is mandatory THEN the system SHALL enforce setup before allowing access to protected resources

### Requirement 6: Advanced Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my active sessions across different devices so that I can monitor and control access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL track device information, location, and session metadata
2. WHEN multiple sessions exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to view and manage all active sessions
3. WHEN concurrent session limits are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce limits per user per workspace
4. WHEN suspicious session activity is detected THEN the system SHALL notify users and optionally terminate sessions
5. IF session timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle cleanup and require re-authentication

### Requirement 7: API Key Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate and manage API keys with specific scopes and permissions so that I can integrate applications securely with the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are generated THEN the system SHALL create keys with configurable expiration and scope limitations
2. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL enforce workspace-specific permissions and rate limiting
3. WHEN API key rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL support seamless key rotation with overlap periods
4. WHEN API keys are compromised THEN the system SHALL allow immediate revocation and audit trail creation
5. IF API key usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL throttle requests and log violations

### Requirement 8: Security Audit and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging and monitoring so that I can track security events and investigate incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log all attempts with timestamps, IP addresses, and outcomes
2. WHEN authorization decisions are made THEN the system SHALL record the decision rationale and context
3. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and trigger automated responses
4. WHEN audit logs are queried THEN the system SHALL provide efficient search and filtering capabilities
5. IF compliance reporting is required THEN the system SHALL generate standardized security reports

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the enhanced authentication system to integrate seamlessly with existing Keycloak and workspace infrastructure so that current functionality remains unaffected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced system is deployed THEN existing Keycloak configurations SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN workspace operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current workspace domain models
3. WHEN user authentication flows execute THEN the system SHALL preserve existing API contracts and responses
4. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and backward compatibility
5. IF configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths and documentation

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the authentication system to handle high loads efficiently so that user experience remains optimal during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication requests are processed THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN token validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use efficient caching mechanisms to minimize database queries
3. WHEN concurrent users authenticate THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally without performance degradation
4. WHEN security policies are evaluated THEN the system SHALL optimize rule evaluation for sub-100ms response times
5. IF system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain security guarantees while gracefully degrading non-critical features
